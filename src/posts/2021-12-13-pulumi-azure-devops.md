## Create a new github repo
Create a new repo in GitHub (or any other Version Control tool), I named mine `pulumi_s3_stack_example`. I selected the option to create a `README.md` file to make it simple to clone the repo once created.

[Source Code](https://github.com/SenorGrande/pulumi_s3_stack_example)

## Create the Pulumi project
In the terminal and at the path of the cloned project, run `pulumi new aws-typescript --force`. I used force because there is already a `README.md` file existing in the repository and Pulumi doesn‚Äôt like creating projects in directories that aren‚Äôt empty.

### Edit the index.ts file
replace the boilerplate code with the following:

```
import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";

const env = process.env.ENVIRONMENT;

// Create an AWS resource (S3 Bucket)
const bucket = new aws.s3.Bucket(`my-bucket-${env}`);

// Export the name of the bucket
export const bucketName = bucket.id;
```

This code (when executed by Pulumi) imports the Pulumi AWS package and then creates an S3 bucket called `my-bucket-[ENVIRONMENT]` where `[ENVIRONMENT]` is replaced with the contents of an environment variable, such as `dev` or `qa`. The name of the bucket is then exported so that it is printed to the console.

**Note:** Pulumi will append the bucket name with a unique identifier.

### Create a Pulumi.qa.yaml file
When we created the Pulumi project, it created a `Pulumi.dev.yaml` by default, create a file for our QA environment called `Pulumi.qa.yaml` and copy the contents of `Pulumi.dev.yaml` into it. Do this for any other environments you want as well.

## Define the Azure Pipeline
Create a directory called `.azure` in the repo and the file `deploy.yaml` and `deploy_template.yaml` in that folder.

Add the following code to `deploy.yaml`:

```
trigger:
  - master

pr: none

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-20.04

variables:
- group: "Deploy"

stages:
  - stage: Deploy_Dev
    displayName: Deploy Dev Infrastructure
    jobs:
      - template: deploy_template.yaml
        parameters:
          environment: 'dev'

  - stage: Deploy_Qa
    displayName: Deploy QA Infrastructure
    jobs:
      - template: deploy_template.yaml
        parameters:
          environment: 'qa'
```

This file will be our pipeline and trigger off of commits into master. It grabs the `Deploy` library that we will create in our Azure DevOps project later.

This pipeline consists of two stages, `Deploy_Dev` and `Deploy_Qa` which each use the `deploy_template.yaml` template and pass in a parameter with the environment name so that the template can provision infrastructure for that environment.

Add the following code to `deploy_template.yaml`:

```
parameters:
- name: 'environment'
  type: string

jobs:
- job: Pulumi
  steps:
  - task: Bash@3
    name: npmInstall
    displayName: NPM Install
    inputs:
      targetType: 'inline'
      script: npm i

  - task: Bash@3
    name: pulumiLogin
    displayName: Pulumi Login
    inputs:
      targetType: 'inline'
      script: pulumi login
    env:
      PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN: $(PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN)

  - task: Bash@3
    name: pulumiStackSelect
    displayName: Pulumi Stack Select
    inputs:
      targetType: 'inline'
      script: pulumi stack select ${{ parameters.environment }} -c --non-interactive

  - task: Bash@3
    name: pulumiUp
    displayName: Pulumi Up
    inputs:
      targetType: 'inline'
      script: pulumi up -y
    env:
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: $(AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID)
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: $(AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
      ENVIRONMENT: ${{ parameters.environment }}
```

This template takes in a parameter that represents the name of the environment this template is being used to provision infrastructure for.

The template also consists of the following four jobs:
* `NPM Install` to install the Pulumi package defined in `package.json`
* `Pulumi Login` to login to your Pulumi account with an access token stored in an Azure Pipelines Library. Note: We‚Äôll create this token and library later.
* `Pulumi Stack Select` to select the stack for the current environment. The flag `-c` is used to create the stack if it does not exist already.
* `Pulumi Up` to create our infrastructure. AWS Access Keys are set as environment variables so that Pulumi can create our S3 bucket. Note: These credentials will also be stored in the Azure Pipelines library.

## Create an Azure DevOps project
Now we will create the Azure DevOps project, pipeline, and library, to automate the deployment of our infrastructure for multiple environments.

![New Azure DevOps Project](2021-12-13-new.png)

Select GitHub (or other VC you‚Äôre using), select your repo and then ‚ÄúSelect existing pipeline template‚Äù

![Configure Azure DevOps Project](2021-12-13-configure.png)

Select the `master` branch and the `/.azure/deploy.yaml` file.

![Select YAML file](2021-12-13-select.png)

Click the arrow next to ‚Äúrun‚Äù and then ‚Äúsave‚Äù.

![Save Pipeline](2021-12-13-save.png)

### Create a library
Create a new library called `Deploy` and add the following variables:
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` ‚Äî Create an IAM user with permissions to S3 and then create security credentials on this user.
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` ‚Äî Same as above
* `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN` ‚Äî Sign in to [Pulumi](https://app.pulumi.com/) and go to your settings and create an access token.

Mark all three of these variables as secret by clicking the padlock icon next to the value.

**Note**: Don‚Äôt forget to click the ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button once you‚Äôre done.

![Pipeline Library](2021-12-13-libary.png)

Run the pipeline manually, or push another commit to trigger the pipeline

![Example of a Pipeline run](2021-12-13-run.png)

Check AWS to see that Pulumi has created new S3 buckets.

![S3 Buckets](2021-12-13-buckets.png)

Run `pulumi destroy` locally to delete the S3 buckets created.

Hoped this helped,
